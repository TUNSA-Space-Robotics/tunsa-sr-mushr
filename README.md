# TUNSA Space Robotics' Multi-agent System for non-Holonomic Racing (MuSHR) ROS Workspaces

The MuSHR programming projects we have done were provided by the University of Washington's CSE478 course for (Winter 2022): https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse478/22wi/projects/
These projects provided us hands-on experience implementing the sense-plan-act paradigm of robotics. We used Python to interface with ROS, a popular robot programming framework that helps organize and integrate the components developed within each project.

This repository contains 2 main ROS workspaces:

# university_of_washington_cse_mushr :

This ROS workspace was forked from University of Washington's MuSHR project on GitLab: https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse478/21sp/mushr478 and worked upon by a team from TUNSA Space Robotics. It includes all dependency packages.

# mushr_tutorials_ws
This is the ROS workspace where we applied all tutorials provided by the MuSHR platform in order to setup a working MuSHR vehicle. The tutorials can be found here: https://mushr.io/tutorials/
